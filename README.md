This is a full-stack project that I decided to squeeze in some time for during my busy semester. The purpose of it is for people to share their best memories of them spending time with their family and friends. Overall, this is a quite complex project that I plan on completing. Later on, I want to implement a login authentication feature along with notifications just as well.
